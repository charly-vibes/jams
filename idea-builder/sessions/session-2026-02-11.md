# Session 2026-02-11 - Repository Structure Adaptation

## Changes

Adapted the existing Architekt app (single monolithic HTML file) to match the jams repository conventions.

## What was done

- **Extracted CSS** from inline `<style>` block to `style.css`
- **Extracted JavaScript** from inline `<script>` block to `script.js`
- **Restructured `index.html`** to reference external CSS/JS files and include repo-standard elements (home-link, footer with GitHub source link)
- **Created `spec/functionality.md`** documenting the app's purpose, features, requirements, and behavior
- **Created `sessions/` directory** for session documentation
- **Removed** Claude conversation HTML file that was not part of the app
- **Registered** the app in the root `script.js` APPS array

## Implementation Decisions

- Added `.home-link` and `footer` styles with `position:fixed` and `z-index:50` since the app uses `position:absolute; inset:0` for view panels, which would otherwise cover these elements
- Kept the PWA inline setup (service worker, manifest) removed since it generates blobs dynamically and doesn't work well with separate files - this functionality was preserved in script.js
- Preserved all original functionality without modification; this was purely a structural refactor

## Notes

- The app uses Spanish language throughout (UI text, prompts, labels)
- The original app name is "Architekt" but lives in the `idea-builder` directory
- The app has a custom warm color scheme (not grayscale) with accent colors for different sections
