# JAMS - Single Page Web Apps

## Purpose

This repository contains single-page web applications, each in its own folder. All apps are designed to be deployed on GitHub Pages and are generated by AI assistants.

## Guidelines

### Structure

Each app should be in a separate folder with the following structure:

```
app-name/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
├── spec/
│   └── functionality.md
└── sessions/
    └── session-YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

### Technical Constraints

- **No frameworks**: Use vanilla JavaScript and CSS only
- **Simplicity first**: Keep code as simple as possible
- **GitHub Pages compatible**: Each app must work when deployed to GitHub Pages
- **Single page**: All functionality in one HTML file with associated CSS/JS

### Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist**: Avoid unnecessary design elements
- **Grayscale**: Use grayscale colors by default unless a specific color scheme is required
- **Functional**: Focus on functionality over aesthetics

### Git Workflow

#### Commit Messages

Follow **Conventional Commits** format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, whitespace)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without behavior change
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
- `feat(calculator): add keyboard support`
- `fix(timer): correct countdown display bug`
- `refactor(utils): extract validation logic`
- `docs(calculator): update spec with new requirements`

#### Tidy First Approach

Follow Martin Fowler's **Tidy First** methodology:

1. **Separate tidying from behavior changes**
   - Make refactoring/cleanup commits separate from feature/fix commits
   - Tidying commits should not change behavior
   - Behavior-changing commits should be minimal and focused

2. **Each commit is a unit of work**
   - Commits should be atomic and reversible
   - A commit should be safe to revert without breaking the codebase
   - Keep commits small and focused on one thing

3. **Commit sequence example:**
   ```
   refactor(app): rename variables for clarity
   refactor(app): extract helper function
   feat(app): add new sorting feature
   ```

4. **Benefits:**
   - Easier code review
   - Safer reverts
   - Clearer history
   - Better bisecting when debugging

### Documentation Requirements

#### spec/ folder
Contains detailed descriptions of the app's functionality, requirements, and intended behavior.

#### sessions/ folder
AI assistants should create session summaries documenting:
- Insights discovered during development
- Issues encountered and their solutions
- Implementation decisions
- Lessons learned
- Code changes and rationale

Each session file should be named `session-YYYY-MM-DD.md` or include a timestamp for multiple sessions per day.
